Task 1: 
a) List all the contents in /etc directory and redirect those contents to a file called “file1.txt”. 
b) List all the contents in /run directory and redirect those contents to a file called “file2.txt”. 
Task 2: 
a) Combine the contents of file1.txt and file2.txt into another file called “unsorted.txt”.
b) Also reverse the combined contents of “file1.txt” and “file2.txt” output to another file called “reversed.txt”.

#.........staring of code...........


ls –a /etc >file1.txt 
ls -a /run >file2.txt
cat file1.txt file2.txt | tee unsorted.txt | sort -r >reversed.txt

Using cat cmd the file1 and file2 are combined and
using "tee" cmd the output of "cat" cmd is saved in a file called "unsorted.txt" as well as it is passed as a
standard input to the "sort" cmd. Pipe(|) cmd is used to join the cat and sort cmds.
sort command got its stdin from cat command's stdout in this case and its ouput is redirected to "reversed.txt"

#..........end of code .......... 


#  Using the command at line 14, all the contents in /etc folder are listed and redirected them to file1.txt.
#  Using the Command at line 15, all the contents in /run folder are listed and redirected them to file2.txt.

#  In this case, file1.txt and file2.txt will be created in the home directory of mine by default,
#  as I did not mention the directory name or path for "file1.txt" and file2.txt.

# .......... genernal information about commands and options used ..........................
#  "ls" cmd is used to list out the contents.
#  "-a" when used along with ls cmd, it lists all the contents including hidden files.
#  "cat" cmd is used to concatenate(combine) files.
#  "|" (pipe) cmd is used to pass standard output(STDOUT) of one cmd as the standard input(STDIN) to another cmd.
#  "tee" cmd is used when we want to save the ouput of one(first) cmd to a file as well as pass that output as an input to another cmd.
#  "sort" is used to sort the contents of a file.
#  "-r" option when used along with "sort" cmd helps to sort in reverse order.
